# Case Study 1

## Customer overview

Fintech company that provides financial services from personal loans to financial resources. It lends money to low-to-moderate-income individuals and helps customers demonstrate their creditworthiness and establish the credit history they need to access new opportunities.

## Challenges

The customer was developing an API to help their customer offer different payment methods. During the development process of the API, the customer faced the following challenges:
- Due to the limited availability of documentation, they relied primarily on customer service solutions such as phone calls or emails to help their customer when they had doubts or faced problems when using the API.
- The customer lacked a solution to communicate with their customers about the API's available information.
- During the duration of the project, the API was still in development and the customer didn't have a way to track the latest changes of the API.

## Approach

To solve the different challenges I performed the following tasks:

- Compare two different tools for creating a Developer Portal using a static site: Slate and ReDoc. The customer preferred ReDoc.
- Used ReDoc inside a React infrastructure to render the portal.
- Proposed a swagger integration for the customer's users to test the API with hard-coded data.
- Used agile methodologies to develop the portal's content and recommended naming conventions for the API parameters to achieve better development practices.

## Outcomes

- The Portal enabled the customer to quickly and easily onboard their partners to integrate their lending services.
- Partner interaction with the customer's product, especially how to use the service, has seen a marked rise through the new Portal.
- The customer now has a self-serve service that enables it to reduce calls to customer service.
- The Portal ensures the adoption and use of the lending service, resulting in increased revenue.
