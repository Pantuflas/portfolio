# Oportun Case Study

## What is Oportun?

Oportun is a fintech company that provides financial services from personal loans to financial resources.
The company's technology-based approach aims to be inclusive, affordable, and empowering. It lends money to low-to-moderate-income individuals and helps customers demonstrate their creditworthiness and establish the credit history they need to access new opportunities.

## Challenges

Oportun was developing an API to help their customer offer different payment methods. During the development process of the API, Oportun faced the following challenges:
- Due to the limited availabity of documentation, Oportun relied primarily on customer services solutions such as phone calls or emails to help their customer when they had doubts or faced problems when using the API.
- Oportun lacked a solution to communicate their customers about the API's available information.
- During the duration of the project, the API was still in development and Oportun didn't have a way to track the latest changes of the API.

## Approach

To solve the different challenges I performed the following tasks:

- Compared two different tools for creating a Developer Portal using a static site: Slate and ReDoc. Oportun preffered ReDoc.
- Used ReDoc inside a React infrastructure to render the portal.
- Proposed a swager integration for Oportun's customer to test the API with hard-coded data.
- Used agile methodologies to develop the portal's content and recomended naming conventions for the API parameters to achieve better development practices.

## Outcomes

- The Portal enabled Oportun to quickly and easily onboard their partners to integrate Oportun’s lending services.
- Partner interaction with Oportun’s product, especially how to use the service, has seen a marked rise through the new Portal.
- Oportun now has a self-serve service that enables it to reduce calls to customer service.
- The Portal ensures the adoption and use of the lending service, resulting in increased revenue.
